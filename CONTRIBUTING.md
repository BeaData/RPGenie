Contributing to the RPGenie project
===================================

Filing a bug report
-------------------

To file a bug report, open the [Issues](https://github.com/Diapolo10/RPGenie/issues) tab and add a new issue, labeling it as a bug report.
If you wish to try and fix it yourself, add yourself as a contributor to that issue. You are allowed to group similiar bugs into one issue report, as long as you don't exceed the limit of three different bugs. Otherwise, make another issue.

Suggesting a new feature
------------------------

To suggest a new feature:
 * For small suggestions, you can directly go to the [Projects](https://github.com/Diapolo10/RPGenie/projects) tab and write a suggestion to the Suggestions/Ideas column
 * For medium-to-large suggestions, write an issue, mark it as part of the current project and label it as a suggestion
 
 You may NOT suggest features through email to the core developers.
 
 Setting up your development environment
 ---------------------------------------
 
 Since RPGenie has very little to do beyond programming and testing, the following should be enough for 95% of all contributors:
  1. A working Git or GitHub installation
  2. A text editor / Python IDE
  3. An installation of Python that supports Python version 3.6 or higher
  4. The following, non-standard PyPI modules (availablle through pip):
      * toml
      * pytest *(used for running the tests locally, not a code dependency)*

If you are running Windows, I'd suggest installing the latest version of Python along with either Visual Studio or Atom, as well as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Of course, you are free to choose your own tools; these are only suggestions.
